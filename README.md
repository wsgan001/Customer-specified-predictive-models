# Customer-specified-predictive-models

Built a model to predict an individual userâ€™s multi-output choice (location). 
It integrated the few (~8 records for each user on average) but informative records of the given user and abundant but less relevant records of other users based on modified random forest and k-NN classifiers, and reached a accuracy that is 3 times higher than that by standard algorithms.
